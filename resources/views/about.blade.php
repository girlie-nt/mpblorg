					Manny Pacquiao launched the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League on August 29, 2017. According to Pacquiao, the league is not intended to be a competitor to the Philippine Basketball Association, the country's top professional basketball league. The MPBL will feature both a regional commercial and barangay-level league with teams on the commercial side to have a home locality in addition to a corporate sponsor.
				</p>
				<p>
					The inaugural cup of the MPBL, the Anta Rajah Cup commenced on January 25, 2018 and was participated in by ten teams.[6] In the opening game at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, the Para√±aque Patriots secured a 70-60 victory over the Caloocan Supremos.[7] The first conference was ran until April 19, 2018 where the Batangas City Athletics crowned as the league's first-ever champion.
